## What is Anov?

# Preprocessing

A line is a sequence of zero or more characters followed by a line ending (CR, LF, or CRLF) or by the end of file.

A character is a unicode code point. This spec does not specify an encoding; it thinks of lines as composed of characters rather than bytes. A conforming parser may be limited to a certain encoding.

A line containing no characters, or a line containing only spaces (after tab expansion), is called a blank line. Blank lines are deleted.
