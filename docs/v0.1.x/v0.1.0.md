# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is Anov?

Anov (Advanced-Novel) is a plain text format for creating novel games. It was developed by [Lemon73](https://github.com/Lemon73-Computing) and distributed in 2023 in the form of the [Alice Novel v0.9.0-alpha](https://github.com/AliceNovel/AliceNovel/tree/v0.9.0-alpha) for running novel games.

### 1.1.1. Design Goals

The design goals of CommonNovel are the following:

- Easy to write, read, and modifire
- Efficient
- Uniformity

### 1.1.2. Scope

*Working in Progress.*

### 1.1.3. Dependencies

CommonNovel depends on the existing standard:

- [Unicode](http://www.unicode.org/versions/latest/), for the representation of import/export names and the text format.

## 1.2. Overview

### 1.2.1. Concepts

*Working in Progress.*

<!--
CommonNovel encodes a high-level novel language. This language is strucutured around the following concepts.

### 1.2.2. Semantic Phases

*Working in Progress.*

# 2. Structure

## 2.1. Conventions

CommonNovel is a novel language that has multiple concrete representations (its binary format and the text format). Both map to a common structure. For conciseness, this structure is described in the form of an abstract syntax. All parts of this specification are defined in terms of this abstract syntax.

# Preprocessing

A line is a sequence of zero or more characters followed by a line ending (CR, LF, or CRLF) or by the end of file.

A character is a unicode code point. This spec does not specify an encoding; it thinks of lines as composed of characters rather than bytes. A conforming parser may be limited to a certain encoding.

A line containing no characters, or a line containing only spaces (after tab expansion), is called a blank line. Blank lines are deleted.
