# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is Anov?

Anov (Advanced-Novel) is a plain text format for creating novel games, based on conventions for indicating formatting in the novel game of Alice Novel. It was developed by [Lemon73](https://github.com/Lemon73-Computing) and distributed in 2023 in the form of the [Alice Novel v0.9.0-alpha](https://github.com/AliceNovel/AliceNovel/tree/v0.9.0-alpha) for running novel games.

## 1.2. Why is a spec needed?

Alice Novel v0.9.0-alpha to v0.9.4 do not specify the syntax unambiguously. (Ignore [Alice Docs](https://github.com/AliceNovel/AliceDocs/tree/d9661d5127fee02f33057ed77421afc23bb0634e/content/en/docs/anov))

To make matters worse, because nothing in Anov counts as a “syntax error,” the divergence often isn’t discovered right away.

## 1.3. About this document

This document attempts to specify Anov syntax unambiguously. It contains many examples with side-by-side Anov and NovelIL.

In the examples, the `→` character is used to represent tabs.
